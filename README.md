VHDL Structural Design Lab — NPTEL Digital Circuits Workshop (IIT Bombay, 2025)
This repository contains a collection of digital logic designs developed by me using structural modeling in VHDL, as part of the NPTEL Digital Circuits Workshop conducted by Wadhwani Electronics Laboratory, IIT Bombay.

Each design folder includes:

✅ Structural VHDL code (original)

🧪 Generic self-checking testbench

📄 Tracefile for verification

📐 Synthesized schematic (PDF)

📘 README with design and simulation details

⚠️ Disclaimer: While all VHDL designs are authored by me, the testbench, DUT, and tracefiles were provided by Wadhwani Electronics Laboratory, IIT Bombay for academic evaluation. I do not claim ownership of these support files — they are used strictly for educational purposes.
