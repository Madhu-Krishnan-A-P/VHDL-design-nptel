VHDL Design Lab — NPTEL Digital Circuits Workshop (IIT Bombay, 2025)
This repository contains a collection of digital logic designs developed by me using behavioral, dataflow, and structural modelling in VHDL, as part of the NPTEL Digital Circuits Workshop conducted by Wadhwani Electronics Laboratory, IIT Bombay.

Each design folder includes:

✅ VHDL design code

🧪 Generic self-checking testbench

📄 Tracefile for verification

📐 Synthesized schematic (PDF)

📘 README with design and simulation details

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** While the VHDL design files are authored by me, the testbench, DUT, tracefiles, and the `Gates` package are provided by Wadhwani Electronics Laboratory, IIT Bombay for academic evaluation. I do not claim ownership of these support files—they are used strictly for educational purposes.
